# JavaScript Error Handling Challenge
In this challenge, you are required to implement a function called `divideNumbers` that takes two numbers as input and returns the result of dividing the first number by the second number. However, there are certain error cases that need to be handled:

- If either of the numbers is not a valid number, the function should throw an error with the message 'Invalid number input'.
- If the second number is zero, the function should throw an error with the message 'Attempted to divide by zero'.

## Setup
Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Testing
Run `npm test` to run the tests and validate your solution.
